# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# Overview

The MERN Task Manager is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features such as authentication, task assignment, priority levels, and due dates. The app also includes OAuth login and image storage with Cloudinary.
